## Recording session
All sessions will be recorded and will be published on YouTube and Facebook. If you don't like to be recorded, please don't join the session.

## Respect everyone
Please respect everyone as it is important no matter what gender is, religion, opinion, age, etc and we don't speak or discuss any of that.

## Using your microphone during the session
Please put your mic off all the time, only open mic when you are speaking and turn it off immediately after you stop talking.

## Our main source of communication
Our main source of information and communication is GitHub under GitHub/DevOpsVisions. So, please keep connected through it. You will find many answers and help to most of your questions about anything related to live sessions, groups, open source, etc. 

It will explain many of your inquiries about our community. So, please try to spend some time reading the Readme and several documents under all repos to get familiar with what we do, how we do it and why we do it.

## Supporting times for old videos/sessions
Since one of the main goals of the live session is to support the old published free courses and videos. 
So, priority questions are the questions that based on missing gaps, difficult parts, extra, etc in the previous videos on session on The YouTube, so when you ask question please tag it as a priority question if it is, so we can know that.

## The open source projects (Group B only)
Another one of the main goals is to build an open source DevOps community to help learn by doing and this will be with Group B (Responsive).

## Speaking during sessions
Anyone can speak at any time during the session but please respect everyone and don't interrupt each other and give everyone space and room to speak and explain.

## Post session survey
The post session survey is very important. The improvement and the decisions regarding the next session is always based on survey. So, please try to make all effort to fill it.

## During session survey (Group B only)
For Group B only, there is during session survey, please keep it opened all the time during the session, I will usually use it to take your opinion about any point or for voting during the session to take decision regarding the subject to continue explaining or enough etc..

Most people joining the meeting without any issue following the instructions provided in the event post on the Facebook page, if you have any issue, it could be regarding your machine configuration or due the meeting reaches out the maximum number (250).

## I want to contribute but I don't know what to do?
You need to learn what does it means to be a contributor and I am trying to help you.
How to start contribution to the DevOps Open Source or any other project, There are only 3 ways to do that…..

1. If you don’t’ like anything, you see an improvement or you have a suggestion, just fork and do it in your repo then raise a PR (Pull Request).

1. If you don’t want to do it, just raise an issue/enhancement/bug, etc. on GitHub related project.
    * EasyApp
https://github.com/DevOpsVisions/EasyApp/issues
    * Docs
https://github.com/DevOpsVisions/Docs/issues

1. If you really want to contribute and do anything but you don’t know from where to start, just go to the backlog and pick any item that you see you can do it, then do as the same as the first point, fork, do it and raise PR.
    * EasyApp
https://github.com/DevOpsVisions/EasyApp/projects/1
    * Docs
https://github.com/DevOpsVisions/Docs/projects/1?

##What if I raised a Pull Request (PR) and it’s not accepted?
It it’s not accepted without any comments, it means you failed to provide any value, therefore always do a PR which has small changes and learn how to provide values. Just think if you can really provide a value, no one will reject that value even if it’s very small but if your PR has many changes and the feedback will take longer time than to do the task by the one that will give the feedback, probably you will not receive a feedback.
E.g. if you correct a spelling mistake in few words and raise a PR, no one will reject that 😊
So, again, always do a small PR and learn from the feedback for your mistakes.

## What is need to contributor to community?
- You need to learn the culture of the community, some of that as the following:
- Honest and transparent.
- Contributor vs. Consumer
- Initiative and Proactive vs. reactive 
- Actions vs. suggestions
- Deep reading
- Do your homework first before asking for help or for more info
- No repeated questions  
- Welling to help before seeking recognition
- Quality of contribution  
- Welling and looking for feedback even if it’s too tough 
- Community only opens the door, you have to walk through it

## Can I ask any question regarding any subject outside the session topic?
**If you are in Group (A) session**
You are only allowed to ask related questions to the discussed topics.
Most of the questions will be at the end of the session, but you can ask a few questions during the session.

**If you are in Group (B) session**
You can ask anything you want at any time, but you have to go for the prerequisites first to make sure this question not already has answer which you can access, here is the the prerequisites:
1. Deeply read the Code of Conduct (CoC) and FAQ
1. If it's technical questions, search my YouTube channel for similar topics first and watch the founded video and if it doesn't cover your questions, prepare your question.
1. If it's regarding the open source project, try to download the project first on your machine, run the unit tests, run the UI tests and so on before asking any questions.

## How this community can help me?
There are many ways you can get benefits from this community.
1. You can join Group (A) sessions where you can learn different topics by attending well-structured sessions.

1. You can join Group (B) and become part of the community where you can contribute to the open source project and learn by doing.

1. You can get a job recommendation by providing good contribution, you will get recognition by the community. Many members of this community are hiring managers who are looking for good people to join their companies. 
So, by showing your skills and what you can do in real projects for the community, they can trust in you then hire you.

1. You can get a mentor to help you improve and plan your career path.
1. You can participate in CoP or CoE and improve your skills and improve your job by being part of that teams or even use their recommendations.

## I heard about groups, so what are they?
It just to dived people based on their interest, and We are divided into two groups until now.

**Group (A) (Well structured)**
- Session is time-boxed to 1 hour
- The session is well structured and has a well-defined agenda which will be sent upfront as part of the invitation.
- Session levels will be set and sent as part of the invitation as well
- Session level will be 3 levels (Beginner/Intermediate, Advanced and Expert level)
- Session is divided into 3 parts explanation, demos, Q&amp;A
- A few questions allowed during the session, the rest of the questions at the last 5-10 minutes of the session within the 1 hour time.

**Group (B) (Responsive)**
- Session is time-boxed to 1 hour
- We will run the sessions as an Agile session.
- The scope of the session defined by time, not by features either topics
- No well-defined agenda.
- I will answer questions regarding my old videos or old session
- Everything based on interactivity and live feedback during the session itself.
- We will discuss, share and work on the DevOps open source projects, etc.
- We will discuss and answer any questions during the session based on a judgment call during the session.
- By default, all people are part of the 2 groups, if you want to be part of one group only, please let me know.
- As Group B has open scope questions, please try to avoid asking the same questions in previous sessions again and again, I hope that people and new people not keep repeating the same questions that we discussed in every session. So, let's try to make every live session is a unique content and not repeated as possible.
