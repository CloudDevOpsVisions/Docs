Code of Conduct
All sessions will be recorded and will be published on YouTube and Facebook. If you don't like to be recorded, please leave the session now.


Please respect everyone as it is important no matter what gender is, religion, opinion, age, etc and we don't speak or discuss any of that.


Please mic off all the time, only open mic when you are speaking and turn it off immediately after you stop talking.


Our single source of information and communication is a Facebook page. So, please keep connected through it. You will find many answers and help to most of your questions about anything related to live sessions, groups, open source, etc. Also, you will find many posts which will explain many of your inquiries about our community. So, please try to spend some time reading some old posts to get familiar with what we do, how we do it and why we do it.

We are divided into two groups until now. Group A (Well structured) and Group B (Responsive), each group run sessions in a different way, please make sure to read more about that in the Facebook page.


As Group B has open scope questions, please try to avoid asking the same questions in previous sessions again and again, I hope that people and new people not keep repeating the same questions that we discussed in every session. So, let’s try to make every live session is a unique content and not repeated as possible.


Since one of the main goals of the live session is to support my published free courses and videos. So, priority questions are the questions that based on missing gaps, difficult parts, extra, etc in my previous videos, so when you ask question please tag it as a priority question if it is, so I can know that.


Another one of the main goals is to build an open source DevOps community and this will be with Group B (Responsive).


Please when you have a question and would like to speak try also to write the question in the session discussion area to make sure there is no missing communication for everyone.


Anyone can speak at any time but please respect everyone and don’t interrupt each other and give everyone space and room to speak and explain.
The post session survey is very important. The improvement and the decisions regarding the next session is always based on survey. So, please try to make all effort to fill it.


For Group B only, there is during the session survey, please keep it opened all the time during the session, I will usually use it to take your opinion about any point or for voting during the session to take decision regarding the subject to continue explaining or enough etc..




For Group B only, as you can ask any question at any time for this group, please try to prepare your questions for the next session up front and send them to my email with subject (Questions for Next Session), so I can add them to the list where people can vote for them, so we can prioritize them based on people decision for the next session.


Usually there is no moderator for the chat, if there is, it will be announced in the beginning of the session. 


Please look at the FAQ post and go through it before asking a new question
